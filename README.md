# Art Portfolio Website

I created this project in an Informatics course I took at Indiana University called "Web Design" which centered around teaching design principles as well as HTML and CSS. For our final project, we were given the task to create a website using what we had learned in class. I chose to create an online portfolio website to showcase my artwork.
